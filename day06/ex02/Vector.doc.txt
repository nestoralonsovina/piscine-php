<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles 3D vectors.
It has an homogeneous 

An instance is contructed from two Vertex orig and dest.
new Vector( array( 'dest' => #instanceOfVertex, 'orig' => #instanceOfVertex );
If the vertex 'orig' is not precised, it will then be (0,0,0) as default.

All Attributes are private, only getters are avaliable.

The following method are providing for this Class:

- magnitude() : give the norme of the instanced Vector.

- normalize() : give the normalized Vector correspondig (a fresh copy
if the instance was already normalized)

- add( Vector $v ) : give the result of the addition between
the current instance and $.

- sub( Vector $v ) : give the result of the substraction between
the current instance and $.

- opposite() : return the opposite Vector;

- scalarProduct( $k ) : return the product of the constant $k
and the current instance;

- dotProduct( Vector $v ) : return the scalar product of the current
instance and $v.

- cos( Vector $v ) : return the cosinus between the current instance and $v

- Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : return the cross product of the vectors
