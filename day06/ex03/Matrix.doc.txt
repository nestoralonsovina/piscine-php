<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles 4x4 Matrixs.
it's predefined constant values for the preset :
IDENTITY    = 'IDENTITY',
SCALE       = 'SCALE',
RX          = 'Ox ROTATION',
RY          = 'Oy ROTATION',
RZ          = 'Oz ROTATION',
TRANSLATION = 'TRANSLATION',
PROJECTION  = 'PROJECTION';

Depending on the preset the values required will be different:
IDENTITY    -> nothing
SCALE       -> the scale - 'scale'.
RX          -> angle of rotation - angle.
RY          -> angle of rotation - angle.
RZ          -> angle of rotation - angle.
TRANSLATION -> vector ( class Vector ) of the translation - 'vtc'.
PROJECTION  -> Field of view ( in degrees ), Ratio (width/height of screen), near and far z distances - 'fov', 'ratio', 'near', 'far'.

Once the Matrix is created there is no way to change it's values.

The following method are provided for this Class:

- mult() : return a new matrix corresponding to the multiplication of the instance by the argument

- transformVertex() : return a new Vertex corresponding to the matrix apply to the one sent in argument
