<h2 id="learning-php-in-15-days">Learning PHP in 15 days</h2>
<p>This is the repository where I store all the work that I did throughout the PHP Piscine @42Paris, a 15 days intensive bootcamp dedicated to learn PHP in a daily-project basis.</p>
<p>The only project that isnâ€™t present here is the group project (built in 2 days - weekend), a basic e-commerce site, with simple user registration features, and shopping cart functionality which can be found here <a href="https://github.com/nestoralonsovina/42-ft_minishop">https://github.com/nestoralonsovina/42-ft_minishop</a>.</p>
<p>During this two weeks we learned from the basics of PHP syntax and SQL queries, to OOP and Js.</p>
<h4 id="as-a-small-index">As a small index:</h4>
<pre><code>	- Day 5 has all the SQL queries
	- Day 9 is JS/JQuery
	- The rest of them is PHP
</code></pre>
